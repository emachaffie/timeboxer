## Timeboxer
Knock out your to-do list

"Work expands to fill the time available for its completion." 

Timeboxing is a very effective way to increase personal productivity. The goal of this web app is to provide users with a convenient timeboxing tool. Currently, there are no timeboxing apps (that I can find...). 

Users will be able to:
- Register and log in to their personal account (Firebase Google auth)
- Add, edit, and delete tasks
- Use the built-in task timer to start and stop their work, automatically recording time spent
- Learn to be more efficient with what they need to do, so they can have more time for what they want to do!
